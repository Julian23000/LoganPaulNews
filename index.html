    <h1>Logan Paul has begun the process of buying back NFTs from fans who lost money in his failed cryptocurrency game.</h1>
    <p class="lead">Logan Paul paying back!</p>
    <p>The YouTube star announced the game CryptoZoo in 2021 but it never materialised, despite fans spending millions on game tokens.

        <p>Paul, 28, has now said he will buy back the NFTs, on the condition that fans who accept do not sue him.</p>
        <p>It is unlikely that fans will get all of their money back.</p>       
        <p>CryptoZoo was meant to be a game where players bought, sold and bred virtual animals using cryptocurrency.</p>       
        <p>At the time, Paul encouraged people to buy cryptocurrency collectables for what he called a <i>"really fun game that makes you money"</i>.</p>     
        <p>However, after selling millions of dollars worth of NFTs and crypto coins, he stopped talking about CryptoZoo and seemingly abandoned the project.</p>    
        <p>After another YouTuber, Coffeezilla, released a series of videos showing his<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=386p68_lDHA"> <b>investigation</b></a> into the project in December 2022, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-64210289"><b>Paul apologised</b></a>, saying he wanted to <i>"make this right".</i></p>
        <p>A year on, he has now announced the start of the buy-back process, which he says will cost him $2.3m (Â£1.8m).</p>
        <p>He will refund players 0.1 Ether, which is a cryptocurrency, per NFT that was bought.</p>      
        <p>The NFTs were originally sold in September 2021 for 0.1 Ether.</p> 
        <p>However, its monetary value has dropped by 37% since the launch of CryptoZoo NFTs, which means fans will still lose out financially.</p>
        <p>In a post on X, formerly Twitter, Paul said: <i>"This buy-back is a way for me to make whole those who intended to play CryptoZoo"</i>.</p>
        <p><i>"The buy-back is not intended to compensate those who gambled on the crypto market and lost."</i>.</p>
        <p>He added that it was <i>"not intended as an investment vehicle"</i>.</p>
        <p>People have until 8 February 2024 to accept the refund, and must do so on the condition that they do not make any legal claims against Paul and other people connected to CryptoZoo.</p>
        <p>One investor who spent $40,000 on NFTs told the BBC last year that he was not interested in a refund and wanted Paul to complete the project to make sure the much-hyped game and NFTs fulfilled their much-hyped potential.</p>
        <p><i>"I don't think it will ever be as big as it could have been but I think it's important that 'founders' do what they promise investors,"</i> the 35-year-old said.</p>
        <p>Paul previously promoted cryptocurrency coin Dink Doink in June 2021, which crashed in value and is now worthless.</p>
        <p>He later <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/27/technology/crypto-influencers.html"><b>told the New York Times</b></a> that he regretted promoting the coin without disclosing the fact that he had helped create it and had a financial stake in the cryptocurrency.</p>
        <p><i>"I definitely didn't act as responsibly as I should have,"</i> he said.</p>
        <p>The CryptoZoo case <i>"highlights the risks associated with investing in a relatively new and unregulated market"</i>, says lawyer Syedur Rahman, partner at firm Rahman Ravelli who specialises in crypto fraud-related cases.</p>
        <p>While Mr Rahman does not think the high-profile cases will have a big impact on the reputation of cryptocurrency overall, he does say that it promotes <i>"discussions about the necessity of additional regulations"</i>.</p>
        <p>The level of regulation differs from country to country, but Mr Rahman says consumers <i>"may well have rights in NFT purchases or things of that nature".</i></p>
        <p>Whether they wish to go through litigation to get back their initial spend depends on how much they put in in the first place, he says - as the cost and inconvenience of going through the courts may outweigh the amount they get back.</p>
